### Time: 15 minutes
### Cook Time: 30 minutes
### Total Time: 45 minutes 
### Servings: 6

#### Ingredients
+ 6 slices french bread cut into 3/4 inch cubes
+ 4 bananas sliced
+ 2 tablespoons brown sugar
+ 1/4 cup cream cheese
+ 3 eggs
+ 1/4 cup milk
+ 1 tablespoon white sugar
+ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
+ 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
+ 2 tablespoons butter chilled and sliced
+ 1/4 cup pecans chopped
+ Pure maple syrup optional

#### Instructions
+ Slice french bread into cubes.
+ Grease a 1 1/2 QT round baking dish or cake pan for the 8 qt Instant Pot. 
+ If you have a smaller pressure cooking pot, use a baking dish that will fit inside of the pot.
+ Add a layer of bread to the bowl. 
+ Layer one sliced banana over the bread, then sprinkle one tablespoon of brown sugar over the bananas.
+ In a microwave, melt the cream cheese 30-45 seconds until it’s creamy enough to spread.
+ Cover the bananas and bread with cream cheese.
+ Add the rest of the bread to the bowl and layer one more sliced banana over the bread.
+ Sprinkle one tablespoon of brown sugar over the bananas and half of the pecans over the top.
+ Place sliced butter pieces over the bread as the top layer.
+ In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk. Whisk milk, white sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon into egg mixture.
+ Pour egg mixture over the bread, making sure to coat the bread well.
+ Pour 3/4 cup water into the pressure cooker pot and place a trivet or pot lifter in the bottom of the pot. If you don’t have a trivet to lift the pan out of the hot pressure cooker, make a sling out of of a large foil strip.
+ Center the pan on the trivet or foil strip and lower it into the pressure cooker.
+ Lock the lid in place. Select High Pressure and set the timer for 25 minutes.
+ If using an Instant Pot, select the porridge button, then add 5 minutes to the cook time.
+ When timer goes off, turn off the pressure cooker and turn the steam release valve to “venting” to release the pressure.
+ Keep french toast pan in pressure cooker to warm for 5 minutes before removing lid.
+ After 5 minutes and the pressure valve has dropped, remove lid and remove dish from pressure cooking pot.
+ Let set for another 5 minutes, then top with sliced bananas, nuts and maple syrup before serving.

*Notes* 
+ 20 minutes cooking time will be fine if you are short on time! 
+ Want a crispy topping? Put the dish under the broiler in the oven for 4-5 minutes to brown the top.
