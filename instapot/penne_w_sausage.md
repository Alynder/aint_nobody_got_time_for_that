+ Cook on 'Manual' (or 'Pressure Cook') mode for 5 minutes.
+ Do a Quick Release of steam, and open the Instant Pot.
+ Press 'Saute'.
+ Stir in cream and simmer the pasta for a couple of minutes until heated through.
+ Turn off Instant Pot and if desired, let the pasta rest for a few minutes to absorb any remaining liquid.
+ Sprinkle each serving with Parmesan and parsley, and red pepper flakes, if using.

##### Notes
To lighten the dish, you could substitute half-and-half for the heavy cream.

The sugar adds a nice balance to the flavor of the tomatoes, but feel free to leave it out.

Prep time does not include steps that are already accounted for in the ingredient list, e.g. chopped onions, minced garlic, diced chicken, etc.
