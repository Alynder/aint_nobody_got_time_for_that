#### Instructions
+ Turn your Instant Pot to saute and add your olive oil and ground beef. 
+ Start to brown your beef, then add your diced onions and cook together until ground beef is no longer pink.  
+ Turn instant pot off by pushing the cancel button (important step). Drain grease and return pot.
+ In a separate bowl whisk together your water & cheddar cheese soup. Pour on top of your ground beef.
+ Pour your uncooked noodles in and do not stir, just push noodles down gently so they are submerged in the liquid. 
+ Close your IP lid and set to manual, pressure, high for 3 minutes. 
+ When done do a slow release meaning barely move your steam valve so the steam comes out slowly, and carefully lift your lid. 
+ Set IP to saute. Add your sour cream and shredded cheese. 
+ Stir slowly and allow it to come to a boil and bubble.
+  It will thicken a bit after a minute or two. Turn IP off. The longer it sits the thicker it will become too. 
+ Serve! (top with more cheese if you're a real cheese lover.
