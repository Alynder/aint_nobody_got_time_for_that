Notes
+ This recipe was made in a 6-quart/6-liter Instant Pot.
+ The cooking time does not include time needed for the pot to come to the pressure and release its pressure.
+ If using large peppers you might need to adjust the cooking time slightly to make sure they are tender and the meat is cooked through.
+ Marjoram can be substituted with oregano.
+ This recipe is enough to fill 4 medium peppers. If you use large peppers you will need more filling.
+ Optional: top cooked stuffed peppers with shredded cheese. 
+ You can also add some ketchup to the tomatoes to make it thicker and richer.
+ The meat to rice ratio can be adjusted to your liking.
